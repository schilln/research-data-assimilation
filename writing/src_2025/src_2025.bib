  abstract   = {Different approaches to using data-driven methods for subgrid-scale closure modeling have emerged recently. Most of these approaches are data-hungry, and lack interpretability and out-of-distribution generalizability. Here, we use \{online\} learning to address parametric uncertainty of well-known physics-based large-eddy simulation ({LES}) closures: the Smagorinsky (Smag) and Leith eddy-viscosity models (1 free parameter) and the Jansen-Held ({JH}) backscattering model (2 free parameters). For 8 cases of 2D geophysical turbulence, optimal parameters are estimated, using ensemble Kalman inversion ({EKI}), such that for each case, the {LES}' energy spectrum matches that of direct numerical simulation ({DNS}). Only a small training dataset is needed to calculate the {DNS} spectra (i.e., the approach is \{data-efficient\}). We find the optimized parameter(s) of each closure to be constant across broad flow regimes that differ in dominant length scales, eddy/jet structures, and dynamics, suggesting that these closures are \{generalizable\}. In a-posteriori tests based on the enstrophy spectra and probability density functions ({PDFs}) of vorticity, {LES} with optimized closures outperform the baselines ({LES} with standard Smag, dynamic Smag or Leith), particularly at the tails of the {PDFs} (extreme events). In a-priori tests, the optimized {JH} significantly outperforms the baselines and optimized Smag and Leith in terms of interscale enstrophy and energy transfers (still, optimized Smag noticeably outperforms standard Smag). The results show the promise of combining advances in physics-based modeling (e.g., {JH}) and data-driven modeling (e.g., \{online\} learning with {EKI}) to develop data-efficient frameworks for accurate, interpretable, and generalizable closures.},

  abstract     = {There is growing interest in discovering interpretable, closed-form equations for subgrid-scale ({SGS}) closures/parameterizations of complex processes in Earth systems. Here, we apply a common equation-discovery technique with expansive libraries to learn closures from filtered direct numerical simulations of 2D turbulence and Rayleigh-Bénard convection ({RBC}). Across common filters (e.g., Gaussian, box), we robustly discover closures of the same form for momentum and heat fluxes. These closures depend on nonlinear combinations of gradients of filtered variables, with constants that are independent of the fluid/flow properties and only depend on filter type/size. We show that these closures are the nonlinear gradient model ({NGM}), which is derivable analytically using Taylor-series. Indeed, we suggest that with common (physics-free) equation-discovery algorithms, for many common systems/physics, discovered closures are consistent with the leading term of the Taylor-series (except when cutoff filters are used). Like previous studies, we find that large-eddy simulations with {NGM} closures are unstable, despite significant similarities between the true and {NGM}-predicted fluxes (correlations {\textgreater}0.95). We identify two shortcomings as reasons for these instabilities: in 2D, {NGM} produces zero kinetic energy transfer between resolved and subgrid scales, lacking both diffusion and backscattering. In {RBC}, potential energy backscattering is poorly predicted. Moreover, we show that {SGS} fluxes diagnosed from data, presumed the “truth” for discovery, depend on filtering procedures and are not unique. Accordingly, to learn accurate, stable closures in future work, we propose several ideas around using physics-informed libraries, loss functions, and metrics. These findings are relevant to closure modeling of any multi-scale system.},
