        An abstract base class defining some common methods and an interface
        on which other classes and functions can rely when using with derived
        classes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        μ
            Nudging parameter
        gs
            Parameter values to be used by the "true" system
        bs
            Fixed parameter values to be used by the nudged system but not to be
            updated (i.e., not to be estimated nor optimized)
        cs
            Estimated parameter values to be used by the nudged system, to be
            estimated/optimized (may or may not correspond to `gs`)
        observed_slice
            The slice denoting the observed part of the true and nudged system
            states when nudging in `f`. May use `jnp.s_` to define slice to use.
            To observed the entire system, use `jnp.s_[:]`.

        Methods
        -------
        f
            Computes the time derivative the true and nudged system, given the
            current states of each and the current estimated parameters for the
            nudged system.
        compute_w
            Computes the leading-order approximation of the sensitivity
            equations.
            May be overridden (see docstring).

        ode
            Computes the time derivative of the true system, given its current
            state.
        estimated_ode
            Computes the time derivative of the nudged system, given its current
            state and the current estimate of its parameters.
